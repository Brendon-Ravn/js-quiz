# Javascript Code Quiz

## Description
This was a homework assignment to build a Quiz using Javascript.<br />
I did have more trouble with this one than the last assignments<br />
but I learned a lot about JS and scope through this activity.

## Usage
To begin the quiz you click the start button. When you are finished<br />
with the quiz it will store your score and you can enter your initials<br />
and see yourself on the score board!
