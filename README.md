# Javascript Code Quiz

## Description
This is a fun little Quiz using Javascript.<br />
I learned a lot about JS and scope through this activity.

## Usage
To begin the quiz you click the start button. When you are finished<br />
with the quiz it will store your score and you can enter your initials<br />
and see yourself on the score board! Once the scoreboard has 10 Top Scores<br />
it will reset back to 1.
